# Next.js Canvas

## Version 1.0.0

### Description

This is a simple Next.js application that demonstrates how to use the `canvas` tag to create a canvas element and draw on it using JavaScript. The application includes a simple drawing tool that allows users to draw on the canvas with their mouse.

In this version, I started with a new Next.js application and creating a canvas. Creating some states and functions to handle the drawing. I also added a button to download the canvas as an PNG image. The first version was quickly created and I didn't spend much time on the design.
